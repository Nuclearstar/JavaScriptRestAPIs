# JavaScript REST APIs

## Abstract:

- This project helps one to build a simple Node.js & Express server and create a set of endpoints. 

- First, you will build an endpoint to retrieve data (GET). 

- Next, you will discover how to create endpoints for POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. 

- Then, you will delve into the different HTTP status codes that you should return from each endpoint. 

- Next, you will explore how to handle exceptions and return a standardized JSON document.

- Finally, you will see how to call your REST APIs from JavaScript using the XMLHttpRequest object. 

- This will help improve one's skills and knowledge of Node.js, Express, and JavaScript needed to build your own REST APIs for use in mobile or other applications.
